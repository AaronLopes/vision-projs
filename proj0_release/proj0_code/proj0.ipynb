Or, you could see the number of tests you have passed, the number or warnings you have, and/or the number of tests you have failed. If you pass all of the tests, it won't show any failures. That is what you want! Showing a few warnings is fine so long as all of the tests are passed. If you fail some of the tests, please return back to the functions associated with the failed tests and fix them so that they pass the test.\n",
