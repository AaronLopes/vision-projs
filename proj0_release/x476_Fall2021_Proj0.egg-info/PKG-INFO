        # Setting up the environment
        For the projects of this course, we will be using `Miniconda` to setup and environment where you can see the project instructions through Jupyter notebook, write your code in Python, test against the unit tests and create the submission files. 
        
        ## Setup
        We will be installing a **NEW** environment for this project; follow the instructions below to set up the env.
        
        1. Install [Miniconda](https://conda.io/miniconda.html). It doesn't matter whether you use Python 2 or 3 because we will create our own environment that uses 3 anyway.
        2. Open Terminal 
        * On Windows, open the installed "Conda prompt" to run the command. 
        * On MacOS and Linux, you can just use a terminal window to run the command
        Navigate to the folder where you have the project.
        3. Create a conda environment using the appropriate command. 
        * Modify the command based on your OS (`linux`, `mac`, or `win`): `conda env create -f proj0_env_<OS>.yml`
        4. This should create an environment named `proj0`. To activate the environment:
        * On Windows, use the command `activate proj0`
        * On MacOS / Linux, use the command `source activate proj0` or `conda activate proj0`.
        5. Install the project package, by running `pip install -e .` inside the folder. (The `.` at the end is of importance. Please do not forget to include it in the command.)
        6. Run the notebook using `jupyter-notebook ./proj0_code/proj0.ipynb`.
