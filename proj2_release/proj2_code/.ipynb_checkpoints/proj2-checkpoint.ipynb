For each pixel, we want to know the probability of it belonging to 'car' (yellow pixels) or it's corresponding negative class, 'not car' (purple pixels). The output value that is generated by a segmentation model may not reflect the answer to this question. For example, a pixel belonging to a car and located at (x1, y1) may output the value 800 and another pixel belong to a car and located at (x2,y2) may output the value 20.
